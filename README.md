**Repository Structure**
Here’s how the project is organized (based on current files/folders):

**Project1_OrangeHRM_Automation/**
├── .idea/                   # IDE configuration
├── pages/                   # Possibly page objects or web-page definitions (if using Page Object Model)
├── reports/                 # Generated reports (html etc.)
├── testdata/                # Test data (maybe JSON, Excel, CSV etc.)
├── tests/                   # Test cases
├── utils/                   # Utility/helper modules
├── main.py                  # Entry-point (maybe to run tests or orchestrator script)
├── pytest.ini               # Pytest configuration
├── report.html              # Sample or last generated report
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── Jenkinsfile              # Jenkins CI pipeline definition
└── README.md                # This file

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x (compatible version)
pip for installing dependencies
Browser driver(s), if tests use Selenium/WebDriver (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver etc.)
Internet access (if tests interact with external environments)

**Installation & Setup**
1) Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/vaibhav4222/Project1_OrangeHRM_Automation.git
   cd Project1_OrangeHRM_Automation
2) Create a virtual environment (recommended)
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Unix/macOS
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
3) Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

**Configuration**
   pytest.ini: This is the pytest configuration file. It probably specifies things like test discovery paths, markers, maybe logging settings.
   testdata/: Contains external data used by tests—provide sample data files here or template files.
   utils/: Utility modules for common functionality (e.g. helpers for setup/teardown, wrappers, etc.)
   pages/: If used, it may represent Page Object Model files to abstract page interactions.

**Make sure:**
   Any required credentials, URLs, or environment-specific data are stored securely (or in configuration files / environment variables), not hard-coded.
   Browser drivers are available in PATH or configured in utils or config.

**Running Tests**
   To run the test suite, from the root directory:
   pytest
   You may want more verbose output:
   pytest -v
   To run specific test files or directories:
   pytest tests/test_some_feature.py
   Or tests under a specific directory:
   pytest tests/

**Reports**
   The repo includes a report.html—likely generated by pytest or a plugin (pytest‐html).
   The reports/ folder stores past or detailed reports.
   You can use plugins such as pytest-html to generate nicer HTML reports:
   pytest --html=reports/latest_report.html

**CI / Jenkins Integration**
   •There’s a Jenkinsfile, so this project is/was set up for integration in Jenkins pipelines.
   •In CI, typical steps would be:
    1) Checkout code
    2) Setup environment (python + dependencies)
    3) Run tests via pytest
    4) Archive or publish test reports (HTML or others)
    5) Fail build if tests fail

**Contributing**
   If someone wishes to contribute, these are suggested practices:
   Fork the repository
   Create a branch for your feature / bugfix
   Write tests for new features or bug fixes
   Follow existing file/folder structure and coding style

Make sure all tests pass locally before pushing
